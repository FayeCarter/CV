I am a **Full Stack Engineer** and recent graduate of the highly selective programming boot camp [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/).


My background is in control systems and electrical and mechanical maintenance engineering which I have worked for the past seven years. Alongside my work as an engineer, I taught myself the basics of programming, familiarizing myself with Python and building small scale projects to improve the working environment and daily tasks for myself and my team.

As a graduate of the Makers Academy I now have the skills to build complex, full stack applications using JavaScript and Ruby. I am trained in OOP, TDD, pair programming and using agile processes.

During my time at Makers I have fallen in love with coding and am excited to bring my passion and enthusiasm to a new role.

## Projects

This is a selection of projects that I have worked on. To see more, [please see my Github](https://github.com/FayeCarter?tab=repositories).

[WhatStack on Github](https://github.com/FayeCarter/WhatStack) <br>
[WhatStack - Live](http://whatstack.herokuapp.com/) 

The aim of the project was to create a welcoming chat room environment for developers to ask for help.

Users can access the site using their GitHub Login details, create a room based around their concern, post a question and receive feedback in real time. 

If the user wants to send a code block, it can be entered using markdown by typing three backticks followed by the language their code is written in. The message will be formatted as a code block in the specified language highlighting variables and correctly indenting each line.

```
#  ```ruby
# name = "Faye"
#  ```
```

## Skills

### Innovate and Streamline

I take great joy in finding simple solutions for complex problems. I like to design applications that will make day to day life easier and more enjoyable.

During my time at Amazon I identified a key issue that was unnecessarily difficult and time consuming. When a printer needed to be replaced, it would take an Engineer thirty minutes to manually update each individual setting. The process involved was not only long but would lead to further faults when an Engineer entered the wrong configuration.

I realised that this could be done more efficiently and that Python would be the best language to help me implement a solution to the problem.

I therefore began to teach myself the basics of Python to build an application that would immediately update the printer with the correct configuration. With the click of a button, the time taken to change a printer was reduced from 30 minutes down to 5 and completely eliminated the risk of human error.

### Assertive Learner

In June 2017 I joined Amazon as an enthusiastic apprentice engineer. I set myself a goal to engage daily with new processes, to ask questions and learn from experienced Engineers and to spend my spare time researching the new skills I was learning. In under six months I was the technical lead for my team in controls based faults, and quickly became known for my ability to absorb new information quickly.

### Problem Solving

I enjoy solving problems with a logical and systematic process, which stems from my work as an Engineer. In tackling a problem, my approach is to deconstruct the problem, separating it into smaller sections. I analyse the key factors of the problem before taking steps to resolve the issue.

Working as an Engineer for one of the best-known companies in the world in the high pressured, fast paced environment of one of the largest warehouses in Europe was an extremely valuable experience. My ability to quickly identify the cause of a breakdown and efficiently resolve the problem was highly valuable and effective, leading to my becoming a key member of the Engineering team.
