I am a **Full Stack Engineer** and recent graduate of the highly selective programming boot camp [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/).


My background is in control systems and electrical and mechanical maintenance engineering which I have worked in over the past seven years. Alongside my work as an engineer, I taught myself the basics of programming, familiarizing myself with Python and building small scale projects to improve the working environment and tasks for myself and my team.

As a graduate of the Makers Academy I now have the skills to build complex, full stack applications using JavaScript and Ruby. I am trained in OOP, TDD, pair programming and using agile processes.
During my time at Makers I have fallen in love with coding and am excited to bring my passion and enthusiasm to my career.

[WhatStack on Github](https://github.com/FayeCarter/WhatStack) <br>
[WhatStack - Live](http://whatstack.herokuapp.com/) 

The aim of the project was to create a welcoming chat room environment for developers to ask for help.

Users can access the site using their GitHub Login details, create a room based around their concern, post a question and receive feedback in real time. 

If the user wants to send a code block, it can be entered using markdown by typing three backticks followed by the language their code is written in. The message will be formatted as a code block in the specified language highlighting variables and correctly indenting each line.

```
#  ```ruby
# name = "Faye"
#  ```
```

## Skills

### Problem Solving

Working as an Engineer, I have developed a love of solving problems with a logical and systematic process. To approach a problem, it is essential that I know how to break the problem down to smaller, more manageable parts and analyse it's key factors before taking steps to resolve the issue.

Working as an Engineer in the high pressured, fast paced environment of one of the largest warehouses in Europe, it was essential that I could quickly identify the cause of a breakdown quickly and efficiently.

### Assertive Learner

It has been essential for me to develop an organised approach to learning as an engineer. Setting achievable goals with manageable steps has been key to me developing in my career. 

In June 2017 I joined Amazon as an apprentice engineer, inexperienced but enthusiastic. Every day I would take the opportunity to engage in processes that I had not before experienced. I asked questions of those that knew more than me and would spend my spare time researching the tasks that I had done. By December I was the technical lead for my team in controls based faults and used these skills.

### Innovate and Streamline

I take great joy in finding simple solutions for complex problems. I like to design applications that will make day to day life easier and more enjoyable.

During my time at Amazon I identified a key issue that was causing unnecessary downtime during our day. If a printer needed to be replaced, It would take an Engineer 30 minutes to manually update every individual setting to configure the Printer and reinstall it into our machines. This process was not only long, but would also lead to further faults when an Engineer would enter the wrong configuration.

I realised that this could be done quicker and more efficiently. I chose to spend my spare time learning the basics of Python to build an application that would update the printer with the correct configuration with the click of a button. In doing so, I reduced the time it would take to change a printer from 30 minutes down to 5 and completely eliminated the risk of human error.
