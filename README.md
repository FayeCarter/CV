I am a junior software engineer, currently studying at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) London. My background is in control systems, electrical and mechanical maintenance engineering, which I have worked in for the past 7 years.

## Skills

### Problem Solving

The basis of my work as an Engineer has been based in solving problems with a logical and systematic process. To approach a problem, It is essential that I know how to break the problem down to smaller, more manageable parts and analysing its key factors before taking steps to resolve the issue.

### Assertive Learner

It has been essential for me to develop an organised approach to learning as an engineer. Setting achievable goals with managebale steps allowed me to develop from an inexperianced engineer to a subject matter in my field.
